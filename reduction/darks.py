      create_median_bias).
    - Read all the images in dark_list and create a list of 2D numpy arrays.

    - Subtract the bias frame from each dark image.
    - Divide each dark image by its exposure time so that you get the dark current
      per second. The exposure time can be found in the header of the FITS file.
    - Use a sigma clipping algorithm to combine all the bias-corrected dark frames
      using the median and removing outliers outside 3-sigma for each pixel.
    - Save the resulting dark frame to a FITS file with the name median_dark_filename.
    - Return the median dark frame as a 2D numpy array.
